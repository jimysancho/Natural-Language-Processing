# Natural Language Repository

In this repository I am going to upload some algorithms / projects regarding NLP. Everything, unless stated otherwise, will be done from scratch: using only `NumPy`. This means that the backpropagation equations will need to be derived. 

When the project is about an algorihtm, you will find either a *`.pdf`* file showing the derivations of the back and forward propagation equations, or the needed math in the *`.md`* file (each folder will have a Readme file in which the process will be shown). 

Right now there are two folders: 

1. **`Word2Vec`**. The Word2vec algorithm to obtain vector representations of words. 

2. **`Word_Prediction`**. Using the scratch implementation of the Word2Vec algorithm, predict the next word of a sentence.
